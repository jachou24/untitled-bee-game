Inspired by the popular indie puzzle stealth game, Untitled Goose Game.

Tiny bee, huge adventure.

Original hand-drawn graphics include the two flowers. For more of my graphics, visit my remake of Friday Night Funkin', available on this github.

For my AP Computer Science Principles exam project, I created an interactive story to raise awareness about the environmental impact bees have and their ecological importance.
